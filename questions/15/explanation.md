Static local variables are initialized the first time control passes through their declaration. The first time `foo()` is called, `b` is attempted initialized. Its constructor is called, which first constructs all member variables. This means `A::A()` is called, printing `a`. `A::A()` then throws an exception, the constructor is aborted, and neither `b` or `B::a` are actually considered constructed. In the catch-block, `c` is printed, and then `foo()` is called again. Since `b` was never initialized the first time, it tries again, this time succeeding, printing `ab`. When `main()` exits, the static variable `b` is destroyed, first calling the destructor printing `B`, and then destroying member variables, printing `A`.
